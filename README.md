Code and model for "Adversarial Laser Beam: Effective Physical-World Attack to DNNs in a Blink" (CVPR 2021)

(All will be done before April 18th, hopefully.)
## Introduction
Natural phenomena may play the role of adversarial attackers, e.g., a blinding glare results in a fatal crash of a Tesla self-driving car.
What if a beam of light can adversarially attack a DNN? Further, how about using a beam of light, specifically the laser beam, as the weapon to perform attacks.
In this work, we show a simple and cool attack by simply using a laser beam.  
To this end, we propose a novel attack method called Adversarial Laser Beam (AdvLB), which enables manipulation of laser beam's physical parameters to perform adversarial attack.
